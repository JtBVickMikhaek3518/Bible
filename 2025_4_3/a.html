<h2 id="the-importance-of-fasting">The Importance Of Fasting</h2>
<p>&quot;<em><sup>29</sup>And he said unto them, <strong>This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</strong></em>&quot; (Mark 9:29)</p>
<p><strong>Fasting</strong> is not a suggestion, but <strong>a command from God</strong>.<br>
<strong>Sins</strong> such as <strong>lust</strong> have <strong>a type of spirit</strong>, especially <strong>lust is a specific spirit</strong>, that can <strong>only come out through fasting</strong>.<br>
Fasting <strong>combats</strong> against the spirit of sin that <strong>capitalizes on the urges of your flesh</strong>.<br>
&rArr; Once you&#39;ve learned fasting to combat, you can <strong>finally break free</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="3-reasons-why-fasting-is-important">3 Reasons Why Fasting Is Important</h2>
<h3 id="1-fasting-deepens-your-relationship-with-god">1. Fasting Deepens Your Relationship With God</h3>
<p>&quot;<em><sup>16</sup><strong>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</strong><sup>17</sup><strong>But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</strong><sup>18</sup><strong>that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</strong></em>&quot; (Matthew 6:16-18)<br>
Also, (James 4:8): &quot;<em><sup>8</sup>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&rArr; When we <strong>fast</strong>, we <strong>draw nearer to God</strong>, and we <strong>deepen a greater relationship with Him</strong>.<br>
&rarr; But <strong>do not look somber</strong>, that means you <strong>shouldn&#39;t be telling people that you&#39;re fasting</strong>, but instead, <strong>keeping that between you and God</strong>. Unless, <strong>you lose your reward from God, and gain human approval, which is earthly</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="2-fasting-strengthens-your-faith">2. Fasting Strengthens Your Faith</h3>
<p>You see: <strong>When you&#39;re not fasting, you&#39;re just feeding your own flesh</strong> and <strong>gratifying yourself</strong>. But <strong>when you fast</strong>, you <strong>take away those earthly pleasures</strong>, those earthly urges like eating food, etc. Hey, <strong>don&#39;t misunderstand fasting</strong>. I&#39;m not saying that you should starve yourself, but <strong>you should abstain from food for a certain amount of time</strong> (e.g. 8hrs, 10hrs, 12, 24, 72,...), to <strong>put your body under submission</strong>, so that <strong>you can control yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;<em><sup>4</sup>But he answered and said, <strong>It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that peoceedeth out of the mouth of God.</strong></em>&quot; (Matthew 4:4)<br>
<strong>Jesus said</strong> this <strong>while fasting in the wilderness, showing</strong> that <strong>spiritual nourishment is more important than earthly food</strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;<em><sup>9</sup>And he said unto me, <strong>My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</strong> Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</em>&quot; (2nd Corinthians 12:9)<br>
<strong>When you fast</strong>, your flesh is weak, but <strong>your spirit is growing day by day</strong>, for fasting <strong>puts your flesh under submission</strong>. As it is, <strong>submit to God</strong> by this and <strong>you yield yourself to the Lord</strong>.<br>
&quot;<em><sup>7</sup>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</em>&quot; (James 4:7)</p>
<h3 id="3-fasting-helps-us-overcome-spiritual-battles">3. Fasting Helps Us Overcome Spiritual Battles</h3>
<p><strong>When you&#39;re facing a temptation that you can&#39;t seem to overcome,</strong> because your flesh is stronger than your spirit, <strong>fast</strong>. When <strong>fasting</strong> evaluates your spirit over your flesh, it <strong>gives your spirit control over your mind</strong>.</p>
<p>We&#39;re either feeding our flesh or spirit in everyday moments, and <strong>the more we feed our flesh, the less we can control ourselves, and the more we fall into sin</strong>. Because we <strong>can not overcome that sin by our flesh, but by our spirit helps us</strong>.</p>
<p>&rArr; If you&#39;re facing strongholds or spiritual warfare.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong><em><sup>21</sup>Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</em></strong>&quot; (Matthew 17:21)</p>
<p><strong>Jesus had prayed and fasted</strong> for 40 days, whereas his Disciples were going to cast out a demon from a boy, but <strong>they hadn&#39;t prepared themselves spiritually. They hadn&#39;t fasted, so that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t have the power</strong> to cast the demon out. <strong>But when Jesus came on the scene, he casted the boy out</strong>, because he had prayed and fasted, and <strong>he had stored up power for his spirit</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="-end">[END]</h2>
<p>To end this study, (Isaiah 58:6): &quot;<em><sup>6</sup>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</em>&quot;</p>
