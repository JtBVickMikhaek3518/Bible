## The Importance Of Fasting
"*<sup>29</sup>And he said unto them, **This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.***" (Mark 9:29)

**Fasting** is not a suggestion, but **a command from God**.<br>
**Sins** such as **lust** have **a type of spirit**, especially **lust is a specific spirit**, that can **only come out through fasting**.<br>
Fasting **combats** against the spirit of sin that **capitalizes on the urges of your flesh**.<br>
&rArr; Once you've learned fasting to combat, you can **finally break free**.

## 3 Reasons Why Fasting Is Important
### 1. Fasting Deepens Your Relationship With God
"*<sup>16</sup>**Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.**<sup>17</sup>**But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;**<sup>18</sup>**that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.***" (Matthew 6:16-18)<br>
Also, (James 4:8): "*<sup>8</sup>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.*"

&rArr; When we **fast**, we **draw nearer to God**, and we **deepen a greater relationship with Him**.<br>
&rarr; But **do not look somber**, that means you **shouldn't be telling people that you're fasting**, but instead, **keeping that between you and God**. Unless, **you lose your reward from God, and gain human approval, which is earthly**.

### 2. Fasting Strengthens Your Faith

You see: **When you're not fasting, you're just feeding your own flesh** and **gratifying yourself**. But **when you fast**, you **take away those earthly pleasures**, those earthly urges like eating food, etc. Hey, **don't misunderstand fasting**. I'm not saying that you should starve yourself, but **you should abstain from food for a certain amount of time** (e.g. 8hrs, 10hrs, 12, 24, 72,...), to **put your body under submission**, so that **you can control yourself**.

"*<sup>4</sup>But he answered and said, **It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that peoceedeth out of the mouth of God.***" (Matthew 4:4)<br>
**Jesus said** this **while fasting in the wilderness, showing** that **spiritual nourishment is more important than earthly food**.

"*<sup>9</sup>And he said unto me, **My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.** Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.*" (2nd Corinthians 12:9)<br>
**When you fast**, your flesh is weak, but **your spirit is growing day by day**, for fasting **puts your flesh under submission**. As it is, **submit to God** by this and **you yield yourself to the Lord**.<br>
"*<sup>7</sup>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.*" (James 4:7)

### 3. Fasting Helps Us Overcome Spiritual Battles

**When you're facing a temptation that you can't seem to overcome,** because your flesh is stronger than your spirit, **fast**. When **fasting** evaluates your spirit over your flesh, it **gives your spirit control over your mind**.

We're either feeding our flesh or spirit in everyday moments, and **the more we feed our flesh, the less we can control ourselves, and the more we fall into sin**. Because we **can not overcome that sin by our flesh, but by our spirit helps us**.

&rArr; If you're facing strongholds or spiritual warfare.
> **Fast**.

#### Some... Context
"***<sup>21</sup>Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.***" (Matthew 17:21)

**Jesus had prayed and fasted** for 40 days, whereas his Disciples were going to cast out a demon from a boy, but **they hadn't prepared themselves spiritually. They hadn't fasted, so that's why they didn't have the power** to cast the demon out. **But when Jesus came on the scene, he casted the boy out**, because he had prayed and fasted, and **he had stored up power for his spirit**.

To end this study, (Isaiah 58:6): "*<sup>6</sup>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?*"
